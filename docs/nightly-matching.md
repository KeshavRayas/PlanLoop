# Nightly matching (Phase 1 + Matcher v2)

Model-free candidate selection. No LLM, no embeddings, no resume tailoring.

## Flow

```text
Vercel Cron 02:00 GET /api/cron/nightly
  → runNightly()
    → runIngestionPipeline() (existing: fetch, validate, cheap filters, upsert)
    → runMatching(runId, topN=25)
      → Profile (default row: skills, floors, role goals, remote prefs)
      → candidates: Job WHERE status=ACTIVE
          AND classificationScore >= 0.70
          AND (postedAt within 30d OR postedAt IS NULL)
      → HARD FILTERS (logged, counted): role-family VETO
          (e.g. DATA_ANNOTATION), location INELIGIBLE
      → scoreJob() per survivor → sort DESC → take TOP 25
      → upsert JobMatch (history retained) → NightlyRun stats
    → getTopMatches(25, runId) → sendNightlyDigest() via Resend
```

## scoreJob contract (`src/lib/matching/score.ts`)

Pure function, zero Prisma/API/LLM deps. Weights (v2, sum 1.0 — old
components keep their relative order):

```text
skills .40, role .15, level .12, recency .08, source .08, salary .07,
location .10
```

Persisted raw components per match: `score, matchedSkills[],
missingSkills[], skillOverlap, salaryFit, salaryScore, recencyDecay,
recencySource (posted|scraped|none), sourceTrust, levelFit, roleFamily,
roleFit, locationFit, reasons[]` — never just the final score.

Key rules:

- Unknown salary → `UNKNOWN` (0.5), never zero. Below `Profile.minSalary` →
  `BELOW` (0).
- No extracted job skills → overlap neutral (0.5), not zero.
- Recency decay: today 1.0 → 1d 0.9 → 3d 0.7 → 7d 0.4 → 30d 0, with
  `effectiveDate = postedAt ?? scrapedAt` (source recorded in reasons).
- Source trust: `sourceScore` 3/2/1/0 → 1.0/0.8/0.6/0.4
  (Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby = 3, Remotive = 1, aggregators = 0).
- Skills normalized through `SKILL_ALIASES` (`ts` → `TypeScript`).
- Role family (`src/lib/matching/roleFamily.ts`): title taxonomy
  BACKEND/INFRASTRUCTURE/DEVOPS_SRE/FULL_STACK/FRONTEND/ML_AI/DATA/
  DATA_ANNOTATION/FORWARD_DEPLOYED/OTHER, checked specific-first so
  annotation never lands in DATA. Fit vs profile goals: STRONG 1.0,
  ACCEPTABLE 0.6, WEAK 0.3 (OTHER), VETO 0. Annotation is vetoed
  unconditionally (different job category, like NON_CS rejection).
- Location (`src/lib/matching/eligibility.ts`): ELIGIBLE 1.0 / UNKNOWN 0.5
  / INELIGIBLE filtered. Home = Bangalore/India/APAC markers in the
  LOCATION (a bare "india" in boilerplate does not count); remote +
  India-based city stays eligible; named foreign/non-home cities without
  remote inclusion are out. Missing info → UNKNOWN, never silent eligible.
- `Profile.baseResumeId` pins the tailoring base resume (seeded from the
  transcribed resume); tailoring never depends on timestamp ordering.

## Calibration

Batch metrics (`npx tsx scripts/calibrate.ts`, scoped to one run):

```text
BAD/EXCELLENT in top 5/10, pairwise inversions, mean rank by verdict,
role-family distribution, location errors, location UNKNOWN-rate
```

`judgmentContext` (`LOCATION_VISIBLE` default, `LOCATION_HIDDEN` for
judgments made without seeing locations) excludes blind rows from
location-specific cuts only. Batch snapshots with reason context:
`npx tsx scripts/judge-queue.ts --export <path>` (see
`scripts/calibration/batch1.json`). Class-level ranking invariants live in
`src/__tests__/rankingInvariants.test.ts` — assert relationships between
job classes (annotation < backend, ineligible never outranks eligible),
never exact floats.

## Flow

```text
Vercel Cron 02:00 GET /api/cron/nightly
  → runNightly()
    → runIngestionPipeline() (existing: fetch, validate, cheap filters, upsert)
    → runMatching(runId, topN=25)
      → Profile (default row; seeded from latest Resume skills on first run)
      → candidates: Job WHERE status=ACTIVE
          AND classificationScore >= 0.70
          AND (postedAt within 30d OR postedAt IS NULL)
      → scoreJob(profile, job) per candidate (pure, see below)
      → sort DESC → take TOP 25 → upsert JobMatch (keeps history:
          older rows retain their previous nightlyRunId)
    → getTopMatches(25, runId) → sendNightlyDigest() via Resend
    → NightlyRun marked success/failed
```

## scoreJob contract (`src/lib/matching/score.ts`)

Pure function, zero Prisma/API/LLM deps:

```ts
scoreJob(profile, job, now?): MatchResult
```

Weights: skills 0.55, level 0.15, recency 0.10, source 0.10, salary 0.10.
Persisted raw components per match: `score, matchedSkills[], missingSkills[],
skillOverlap, salaryFit (MATCH|BELOW|UNKNOWN), salaryScore, recencyDecay,
sourceTrust, levelFit, reasons[]` — never just the final score, so weights
can be retuned later without reverse-engineering.

Key rules:

- Unknown salary → `UNKNOWN` (0.5), never zero. Below `Profile.minSalary` →
  `BELOW` (0).
- No extracted job skills → overlap neutral (0.5), not zero.
- Recency decay: today 1.0 → 1d 0.9 → 3d 0.7 → 7d 0.4 → 30d 0.
- Source trust: `sourceScore` 3/2/1/0 → 1.0/0.8/0.6/0.4
  (Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby = 3, Remotive = 1, aggregators = 0).
- Skills normalized through `SKILL_ALIASES` (`ts` → `TypeScript`).

## Explicitly out of scope (Phase 2+)

Tailored resumes in nightly, LLM calls, embeddings, morning Analyze/Tailor
actions, feedback-weight learning, aggressive liveness crawling.

## Env

- `DIGEST_TO_EMAIL` — digest recipient. When unset (or `RESEND_API_KEY`
  unset), the digest is skipped with a log line and the run still succeeds.
- `DIGEST_FROM_EMAIL` — optional sender override (verified domain).
